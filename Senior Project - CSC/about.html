        Welcome to FestFinder, this website is for all types of music enthusiasts. The idea of FestFinder was for people to have a navigation
        for raves as well as just know what events are near them. Me being a raver outside of programming it had inspired me to make this my 
        senior project as it helps people and it still is part of my passions outside of coding. As well the inspiration with this project was
        to help navigate because when I started going to music festivals I felt it was hard to figure out which ones were near me. With the 
        FestFinder web application this makes searching for a festival a lot easier as it will tell you a rough estimate of distance between you
        and festivals around you.
    </p>
    <h2> How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        With the FestFinders functionality I wanted to challenge myself with my coding abilities as I wanted to make something that I could use
        if I wanted to. The way of how the distance is shown is by allowing the website to take your location (longitude, latitude) and then
        use distance equations to output the distance between you and many festivals. I got my list of festivals from experience as well as I had 
        to research into some of them as I wanted to widen my range of variables for better testing purposes. There is many festivals that are in 
        the United States as well as I wanted to add some out of country variables to allow for more results but also usability to be more universal.
